# MLAnimation
 Repo for storing the files I use to make animations with BigSleep and DeepDaze. WIP

 Use this colab to make DeepDaze renders with a base image: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12EU4iVue3I91Pfqo5hc0-gXOtc81e3kK?usp=sharing
 Uses the MLAnimation.py to be able to sort and animate the frames.
